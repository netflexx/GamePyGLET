+Your strategy so that everybody understands the codebase:

	1. Use MEANINGFUL comments frequently. 
       Ex: # input --> WRONG 
	       # get input, then store it in a dict in order to use in the XX part --> RIGHT
	2. Choose Englissh-like name for variable:
       Ex: asd = False --> WRONG
	       cycle_night = False --> RIGHT
	3. Discuss and explain codes between members.
